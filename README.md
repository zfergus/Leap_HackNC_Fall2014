Leap_HackNC_Fall2014
====================

Circuit Fun is a project created for HackNC Fall 2014, a 24-hour hackathon where
participants make the best projects they can in the limited time. It was 
developed in C# using the Unity game engine and the Leap Motion SDK. The object
of the program is to combine different electronics components together to light
up the LED's. It currently includes batteries (black rectangular prism), circuit
board (light blue plane), RGB LED's (white, red, green, and blue cubes), and 
resistors (brown and tan cubes). The program is in a 3D environment and allows
the parts to be moved around via motion controls through the Leap Motion. 
Designed to educate younger children in basic circuitry and electricity, this 
simple 3D game is a great learning tool. As it stands, stands Circuit Fun is a 
prototype that shows of the Leap Motions capabilities and potential in an 
educational environment, but has a lot of potential.
