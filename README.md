====================

Circuit Fun is a project created for HackNC Fall 2014, a 24-hour hackathon where
participants make the best projects they can in the limited time. It was
developed in C# using the Unity game engine and the Leap Motion SDK. The object
of the program is to combine different electronics components together to light
up the LED's. It currently includes a battery, a bread board, white, red, green,
and blue LEDs, and two different resistors. Parts can be moved around using
motion controls through the Leap Motion. Designed to educate younger children
in basic circuitry and electricity, this simple 3D game is a great learning
tool. As it stands, stands Circuit Fun is a prototype that shows off the
Leap Motions capabilities and potential in an educational environment.
